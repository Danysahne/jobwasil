# Job Search App

This repository contains a simple React project demonstrating a dummy job search application. The app runs in the browser and now includes theme switching, job type filters and a clearer layout.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure Node.js is installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `public/index.html` – HTML entry point.
- `src/App.js` – Main application component with search, filter controls and a theme toggle.
- `package.json` – Project metadata and scripts. A test script prints "No tests yet".

Feel free to expand this skeleton with real job listings, network requests or additional features. The current demo lets you search through a small set of jobs, filter by job type and switch between light and dark themes.
