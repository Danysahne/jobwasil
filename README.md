# Job Search App

This repository contains a minimal React Native project for a job search application.
It now also includes example Swift projects demonstrating basic iOS and macOS apps.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have the React Native development environment set up. See the [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for instructions.
2. Install dependencies (may require internet access):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run on Android:
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```
4. Run on iOS:
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   ```

## Project Structure

- `src/App.js` - Main React Native component.

- `android/` - Placeholder for an Android project.
- `macos/` - Contains a minimal SwiftUI macOS example.

Feel free to expand on this skeleton to add job listings, search functionality, and more.
